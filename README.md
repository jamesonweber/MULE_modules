# MULE Modules
Arduino code for collecting data and generating packets (depth information) to send to the MULE pi (moduleOS)

# Summary
The MULE (Modular Underwater Linked Explorer) is a remotely controlled underwater drone. The MULE was created as a final year interdisciplinary engineering capstone project with work from a group of mechanical, electrical, geomatics, and software engineering discipline students.

The overall solution consisted of four main components
- An operational, underwater vehicle
- A standardized system for attaching scientific data sensors
- A social network for citizen science and a database for sensor reading
- An application for remotely controlling the underwater vehicle

This git project contains a demo of a potential depth sensor that could be attached to the MULE and have it's data relayed to the MULE real time, and optionally posted to the social network.
